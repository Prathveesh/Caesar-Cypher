# Caesar-Cypher

  Caesar cypher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

  Here in this project i have written a code, which does the same encription. It takes the Text which should be cyphered and the number of shifts and gives the encrypted text or vica-versa. And is written in Python
